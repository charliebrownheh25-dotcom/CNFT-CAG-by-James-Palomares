## 🧠 Abstract

Cymaticnucleation Field Theory (CNFT) proposes that structured acoustic waveforms—specifically cymatic geometries—can deterministically initiate nucleation events within quantum fields. This theory bridges cymatics and quantum acoustics, introducing a phase-engineered framework for controlled transitions in energetic and material systems.

Cymatic Attribution Geometry (CAG) complements CNFT by embedding contributor equity and timestamped attribution into every phase event, ensuring scientific accountability and legal traceability.

## 🔬 Theory Overview

### CNFT: Cymaticnucleation Field Theory

- **Premise**: Acoustic waveforms generate cymatic patterns that act as nucleation catalysts.
- **Mechanism**: Phase transitions are triggered by cymatic geometries tuned to specific quantum field conditions.
- **Outcome**: Deterministic control of nucleation events, enabling engineered material synthesis and quantum substrate formation.

### CAG: Cymatic Attribution Geometry

- **Premise**: Every cymatic event carries embedded metadata for contributor attribution.
- **Mechanism**: Timestamped logs, equity shares, and audit trails are encoded into each simulation and payout.
- **Outcome**: Transparent, legally certifiable innovation with automated royalty tracking.
